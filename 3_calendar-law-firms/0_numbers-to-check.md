# Validation Questions - Calendar Intelligence for Law Firms

## 1. CONTEXT (Baseline Assumptions)
- **Partner meetings per week** - Affects the magnitude of scheduling pain and learning data volume (assuming 25-30)
- **Partner $/hr** - Determines ROI calculation for time recovery (assuming $500-$1000)
- **EAs:partner ratio** - Indicates whether partners self-manage or have assistant support, affects ICP targeting
- **Compensation tied to billable hours** - Validates if partners personally feel pain of lost time (% of partners with this model)
- **EA salary** - Quantifies cost of manual scheduling infrastructure (baseline for efficiency savings)
- **EA constant vs. changing staff** - Affects institutional knowledge loss and error rates

## 2. PROBLEM (Pain Validation)
- **What % of partners self-manage calendars** - Validates core problem of partners losing billable hours to admin work
- **EA time spent on scheduling per week / number of meetings per week** - Quantifies assistant pain and calculates coordination overhead per meeting
- **What's their workaround today?** - Understanding current solution reveals switching friction and "good enough" threshold
- **How often do coordination problems actually occur?** - Validates pain intensity assumption (assuming weekly, needs verification)
- **Internal vs. external meeting ratio** - Determines primary user of booking experience (affects UX and feature priorities)

## 3. IMPACT (Value Quantification)
- **Lost billable hours due to coordination problems** - Measures revenue loss from errors (double-bookings, timezone mistakes, cancellations)
- **Lost billable hours due to inefficient scheduling** - Quantifies waste from priority-blind scheduling and poor time allocation
- **Lost billable hours due to partners doing admin work** - Core value prop—how much billable time is lost to scheduling coordination
- **Do partners track time currently?** - Critical for proving ROI—without time tracking, can't measure/demonstrate billable hour recovery
- **Partners awareness** - Determines if we're selling aspirin (known pain) or vitamins (latent problem)
- **Firms awareness** - Validates if leadership recognizes problem (affects buying process)

## 4. BUYING HABITS (Purchase Process)
- **Who owns procurement?** - Identifies decision-maker and sales process complexity
- **Who has authority to approve?** - Validates multi-stakeholder buying vs. single decision-maker
- **How does budget look like? Is there a budget line?** - Confirms budget availability and purchasing friction
- **Price point tolerance (~$50 vs. Clio/MyCase budget)** - Validates premium pricing assumption of $75-150/user
- **Recent tool purchases & how they evaluated it** - Reveals real buying behavior, evaluation criteria, and decision timeline

## 5. ICP (Stakeholder Buy-In)
**Partner:**
- **Compensation tied to billable hours** - Validates direct financial motivation to recover time
- **Personal frustration / ego** - Measures emotional pain driving individual adoption
- **Care about firm performance** - Indicates if they'll champion firm-wide rollout
- **Are they aware of the problem?** - Determines if pain is conscious or needs education

**Assistant:**
- **Care about their own efficiency & work** - Validates if they see personal benefit
- **Personal frustration** - Measures emotional pain driving adoption
- **Will adopt tool or see it as threat?** - Critical adoption risk—could kill partner usage

**Practice Manager / Director of Operations / Innovation:**
- **In their KPIs?** - Validates if they're measured on efficiency/productivity
- **Want to look good for the partners** - Indicates motivation to solve visible partner pain

**Billing/Finance Director:**
- **Cares about financial metrics - utilization & bottom line** - Validates if they'll champion based on revenue impact

**Multi-stakeholder:**
- **Do we need multiple buy-ins or one person is enough?** - Determines sales cycle length and complexity

## 6. POSITIONING & DIFFERENTIATION (Category Validation)
- **What do they call this problem today?** - Understanding their language enables effective marketing and sales messaging
- **Feature differentiation** - Validates if we have defensible capabilities vs. competitors
- **Value prop - billable hours optimization. Resonates?** - Tests if ROI messaging lands with buyers
- **Do customers buy "calendar intelligence with billable hour ROI" vs. "expensive Calendly"?** - Critical positioning test—validates premium pricing vs. commodity perception

## 7. COMPETITION (White Space Validation)
- **Practice management software - offers scheduling?** - Tests if incumbents already solve this (would invalidate thesis)
- **Horizontal scheduling effectiveness** - Measures satisfaction with Calendly/competitors and switching friction

## 8. PRODUCT (Design Requirements)
- **Who usually reaches out - client or lawyer?** - Determines primary workflow pattern and booking link design
- **What's main scheduling mechanism - email? phone? whatsapp?** - Affects integration requirements and UX design

## 9. SOLUTION
- (To be filled based on validation findings)

## 10. TECH (Feasibility)
- **Can we extract pattern signals from Phase 1 usage?** - Validates data foundation for Phase 2-3 intelligence (moat assumption)
- **Can we achieve <1 error per 100 bookings?** - Table stakes reliability for professional services trust

## 11. GO TO MARKET (Expansion Strategy)
- **Law firm entry unlock other professional services?** - Validates horizontal expansion thesis to consulting, accounting, wealth advisory
