Context ->
1. Partner meetings per week (assuming 25-30)
2. Partner $/hr (assuming $500-$1000)
3. EAs:partner ratio
4. Compensation tied to billable hours
5. EA salary
6. EA constant vs. changing staff 

Problem ->
1. What % of partners self manage calendars
2. EA time spent on scheduling per week / number of meetings per week

Impact ->
3. Lost billable hours due to coordination problems
4. Lost billable hours due to inefficient scheduling    
5. Lost billable hours due to partners doing admin work
6. Partners awareness
7. Firms awareness

Buying habits ->
1. Who owns procurement? 
2. Who has authority to approve?
3. How does budget look like? Is there a budget line?
4. Assuming price point ~$50 (Budget for practice management systems Clio, MyCase)

ICP ->
1. Partner - 
- Compensation tied to billable hours 
- Personal frustration / ego
- Care about firm performance
- Are they aware to the problem?
2. Assistant - 
- Care about their own efficiency & work
- Personal frustration

3. Practice Manager / Director of Operations / Innovation

Competition & Diffrentiation->
1. Feature diffrentiation
2. Value prop - billable hours optimization. Reasonates?

Solution Validation (Phase 1: Technical Spike - 4 weeks)
Calendar intelligence automation (not just booking logistics):
[ ] Conflict detection accuracy: Can we achieve <1 error per 100 bookings across complex calendar rules?
[ ] Multi-party coordination: Does overlapping availability finder work with 3-5+ participants (depositions, mediations)?
[ ] Data capture for Phase 2: Can we extract pattern signals (time preferences, meeting type patterns, relationship frequency) from Phase 1 usage?
[ ] Integration reliability: Do Google/Outlook Calendar APIs provide sufficient data and sync speed (<30 sec booking-to-calendar-event)?
Category Validation (Phase 1: Competitive Audit)
New category, not feature competition:
[ ] White space confirmed: No one positions as "Calendar Intelligence for Professional Services" with billable hour attribution
[ ] Category gap: Existing tools are "Scheduling Automation" (Calendly) OR "Practice Management" (Clio), not calendar intelligence
[ ] Newly possible: Is LLM-based Phase 2-3 intelligence truly the enabler that makes strategic calendar understanding feasible?
[ ] Framing acceptance: Do customers buy "calendar intelligence with billable hour ROI" vs. "expensive Calendly"?
[ ] Defensibility: Clear moat through data accumulation (calendar patterns + case outcomes + strategic context)?
Market Validation (After design partner phase)
Vertical SaaS business model:
[ ] TAM sufficiency: Can we reach $50M+ ARR in mid-market law firms (15K-20K firms × $3.75K-7.5K average contract value)?
[ ] Firm size segment validated: Did we pick right entry (20-50 vs. 50-200 attorney firms)? Highest pain + procurement authority + adoption readiness?
[ ] Multi-buyer sales: Do we win with Practice Manager + Partner + Assistant champions, or single buyer sufficient?
[ ] Category pricing power: Can we sustain $75-150/user based on ROI vs. getting compared to $10-20 horizontal tools?
[ ] Retention mechanism: Do customers stay because switching loses calendar intelligence (Phase 2 pattern learning creates lock-in)?
[ ] Expansion viability: Does law firm entry unlock other professional services (consulting, accounting, wealth advisory) with same billable hour pattern?
