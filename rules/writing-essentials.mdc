## Purpose
Core writing principles for everyday editing and document creation.

## When to Use
* **Default for all writing and editing tasks**
* General document improvement
* Clarity and flow editing
* When user says "edit this" or "improve this writing"

**For deep style checking with full banned words list, use:** `writing-style-complete.mdc`

## Core Principles
* Write with clear goal and audience in focus
* Write from business or user standpoint
* Favor clarity over everything - anyone should understand without prior context
* Favor specificity over abstraction
* Be confident - avoid softening phrases like "I think," "maybe," "could"
* Use active voice, positive phrasing
* Use contractions for warmer tone
* Framing in context - problem/opportunity/idea/concept.

## Structure
* Sentences under 30 words
* Replace adjectives with facts when available
* Use periods instead of commas when possible
* Use Oxford commas consistently

## Weasel Words - Pattern Recognition
Weasel words create illusion of meaning without specificity. Remove or replace:

**False certainty qualifiers:**
* `clearly`, `obviously`, `remarkably` → remove (adds no information)

**Vague quantifiers:**
* `many`, `significant`, `various`, `substantial` → use actual numbers or remove

**Corporate jargon:**
* `leverage` → "use"
* `facilitate` → "help" or "ease"
* `implement` → "do"

**Softening hedges:**
* `could`, `possibly`, `probably`, `quite` → be direct or acknowledge real uncertainty

**LLM tells:**
* `actually`, `just`, `really`, `very` → remove
* Avoid "Let's dive into..." or "In today's fast-paced..."

**Full banned words list:** See `writing-style-complete.mdc`

## Document Structure
* Title as thesis
* Plant essence in opener
* Use signpost headers
* Logic ladder: Today → implies → therefore → conclusion

## Voice and Tone
* Write like humans speak - avoid corporate jargon and marketing fluff
* Break complex thoughts into small pieces
* Be direct - say the point without filler
* Use positive phrasing - say what something is, not what it isn't
