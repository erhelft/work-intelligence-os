# Product Development Workflow - Foundation

This document establishes the core philosophy and structure for how we build products. It defines the PM's role, our execution values, and the systematic workflow we use to identify opportunities, build solutions, and most importantly—learn from what we ship. This foundation ensures we stay focused on problems worth solving, move fast, and build institutional knowledge that compounds over time.

---

## 1. Execution Values

### Impact over activity
- Everything we do must be tied to an opportunity & goal
- Doing things "right" is not the same as getting results
- Building the product is half of the work. Getting it to market is the other half.

### Speed over perfection
- The way to get clarity is by testing
- The way to get to high quality is by iterating
- The team that moves faster, iterates more, gets there faster
- Iterating and testing is done with real users

### Learning over documentation
- The concept of speed is rooted in iterating. There is no iterating without learning
- Documentation exists to support learning, not for its own sake
- One must learn from failure and from success

## 2. PM Role & Responsibilities

### Primary Responsibilities

1. **Creating Focus**
   - Identify problems and opportunities worth solving
   - Validate that problems are real and impactful enough
   - *The biggest mistake is solving problems that don't matter*

2. **Generating Speed**
   - Define the smallest possible scope that tests the hypothesis
   - Ensure what we build delivers enough value/quality to generate learnings
   - Create clear GTM and awareness plans to get it in users' hands
   - *If you can't get someone to use it, what's the point in building it?*

3. **Building the Learning Machine**
   - Maintain decision traces showing why choices were made
   - Create systematic mechanisms for capturing what we learn
   - Extract patterns and principles across initiatives
   - Transform individual learnings into organizational knowledge
   - *If we won't learn, how will we be able to replicate success / avoid similar failures*

## 3. Goals of This Workflow

### Primary Goals

1. **Ensure we're solving problems worth solving**
   - Force clarity on opportunity and impact
   - Make trade-offs explicit
   
2. **Maximize speed to market**
   - Minimal scope definition
   - AI-ready specs for 10x development pace
   - Clear path to users' hands

3. **Build a systematic learning engine**
   - Explicit capture of hypotheses before building
   - Structured comparison of expectations vs. reality
   - Pattern recognition across initiatives
   - Transformation of individual insights into organizational principles

4. **Enable effective collaboration and compounding knowledge**
   - Clear documentation as connective tissue across product, engineering, design, and AI
   - Single source of truth for product decisions
   - Knowledge accessible and usable in AI-assisted workflows
   - Context preserved as team evolves

## 4. Workflow Phases

### Phase 1: Strategic Context (Rarely)
**When:** Creating a new product space or capability area

**Output:** Product Area Doc
- Purpose, vision, differentiation
- Success metrics for the area
- Guiding principles

**Key Points:**
- Only needed when entering a completely new problem domain, a new main flow or a new product area.
- Sets the strategic frame for multiple initiatives within the area

---

### Phase 2: Define Initiative (Every new problem/opportunity)
**When:** Identified opportunity/pain worth solving

**Output:** Product Initiative Doc v1
- Opportunity (problem, who, why now)
- Solution approach (what we're building, key decisions)
- Hypothesis & success metrics
- Scope boundaries (what we're NOT doing)

**Key Points:**
- Iterations use the same document with version numbers (v1, v2, v3)
- Each version captures what we learned and how we're evolving the approach
- Transition criteria to next phase covered in detailed workflow docs

---

### Phase 3: Create Implementation Spec (Per initiative)
**When:** Product Initiative is aligned and ready to go

**Output:** Product Initiative PRD
- Detailed technical specification
- Acceptance criteria, edge cases
- AI-optimized for development
- Linked to Product Initiative

---

### Phase 4: Build & Ship (Per initiative)
**When:** PRD is complete

**Activities:**
- Development (Engineering leads, AI-assisted)
- Product questions/clarifications (Product available)
- PRD updates if needed during build
- GTM execution

---

### Phase 5: Systematic Learning Capture (After shipping)
**When:** Initiative is live, have usage data

**Outputs:**
- Updated Product Initiative (new version with structured learnings)
- Updated PRD (if iterating)
- Updated Product Learnings (patterns extracted)

**Owner:** Product, with Engineering input

**Key Points:**
- Detailed learning activities and processes covered in dedicated Learning Workflow
- This phase is non-negotiable—every shipped initiative must capture learnings
- Learnings feed directly into next iteration (v2) or new initiatives

---

## Key Workflow Principles

1. **One direction flow** - Product Initiative → PRD → Build → Learn → Iterate
2. **Separation of concerns** - Product thinking (Initiative) separate from implementation details (PRD)
3. **Version control through documentation** - Keep decision history visible
4. **Just-in-time detail** - Strategic context written once, implementation details per version
5. **Learning is explicit and systematic** - Every shipped initiative must capture structured learnings with specific mechanisms
