# Blueprint Feedback Log

This log captures feedback from blueprint creation sessions to help improve the blueprint workflow over time.

## How to Use This Log

After each blueprint is created, the LLM captures feedback on five dimensions:
- **Completeness:** Did the blueprint capture the full essence?
- **Accuracy:** Did anything feel "off" or get lost in translation?
- **Phases:** Did the phase architecture capture the right structure? (This is the heart of the workflow)
- **Process friction:** Were there moments where the questions didn't fit?
- **Open feedback:** Any other observations or suggestions

Review this log periodically to identify patterns and improve `blueprint-creation.md` and `blueprint-template.md`.
