# Main Scheduling Flows

## Purpose
This document maps the core scheduling flows in law firm calendar management across different meeting types and complexity levels. These flows serve as the foundation for understanding scheduling coordination challenges.

## GTM Phase Prioritization

**Phase 1 Priority Flows** (Entry via EA Productivity):
- **Flow 1**: External + Single-Party — Highest EA coordination burden, entry wedge
- **Flow 5**: Ad-Hoc Event Change — Cascade rescheduling causes massive EA time drain

**Phase 1 Expansion Flows** (Partner Self-Scheduling):
- **Flow 1 variant**: Partner self-schedules without EA involvement
- **Flow 3**: Internal + Single-Party — Quick wins for partners without EA support

**Phase 2+ Flows** (Strategic Value):
- **Flow 2**: External + Multi-Party — Complex coordination, higher value but harder
- **Flow 4**: Internal + Multi-Party — Firm-wide meeting optimization

## Flow Dimensions

**Meeting Type**: Who participates?
- **External**: Includes clients, opposing counsel, experts, court reporters, or any non-firm participants
- **Internal**: Firm-only participants (partners, associates, assistants, staff)

**Complexity**: How many parties involved?
- **Single-party**: 1:1 meetings (two people total)
- **Multi-party**: 3+ people involved in the meeting

**Initiator**: Who starts the scheduling process?
- **User-initiated**: Partner or firm assistant initiates scheduling
- **3rd party-initiated**: Client, opposing counsel, or external party initiates scheduling

## Core Flows

### Flow 1: External + Single-Party ⭐ PHASE 1 PRIORITY

**Use Case**: Partner needs to schedule 1:1 client consultation about an ongoing case.

**Initiator**: Can be either user-initiated or 3rd party-initiated
- User-initiated: Partner reaches out to schedule with client
- 3rd party-initiated: Client requests meeting with partner

**Current Workflow**:
1. One party emails/calls the other requesting a meeting
2. Proposed times are shared (usually 2-3 options)
3. Back-and-forth exchange to find mutually available time (typically 3-5 exchanges)
4. Once time agreed upon, calendar invite is sent
5. Confirmation received and meeting scheduled
6. If timezone differences exist, manual conversion required

**Current Challenges**:
- 3-5 email exchanges per meeting consume 15-30 minutes of coordination time
- Partner time spent on coordination instead of billable work (Problem #3)
- Response delays impact client experience and relationship quality
- Timezone confusion for remote/international clients causes errors (Problem #1)
- Assistant overhead managing back-and-forth for multiple partners simultaneously
- No systematic capture of client scheduling preferences
- First-come-first-served regardless of meeting value or client priority

### Flow 2: External + Multi-Party 📍 PHASE 2+

**Use Case**: Coordinating a deposition involving partner, client, opposing counsel, court reporter, and expert witness (5+ participants).

**Initiator**: Can be either user-initiated or 3rd party-initiated
- User-initiated: Firm needs to schedule deposition and coordinates all parties
- 3rd party-initiated: Opposing counsel proposes deposition and seeks coordination

**Current Workflow**:
1. One party identifies need for multi-party meeting
2. Assistant/coordinator collects availability from all participants
3. Availability is compiled manually (often via email chains or calls)
4. Assistant identifies overlapping time slots
5. Proposed time is shared with all parties for confirmation
6. Multiple rounds of adjustment as conflicts emerge
7. Once consensus reached, invites sent to all parties
8. Process takes days to weeks depending on participant complexity

**Current Challenges**:
- 3-5 hours of coordination time per complex meeting (Problem #6)
- Meeting delayed 2-4 weeks due to coordination difficulty
- Calendar conflicts discovered late in the process, requiring restart
- Managing multiple email threads and losing track of responses
- Difficulty finding overlapping availability across busy schedules
- Some participants not included or invited to wrong time
- Timezone complexity multiplied across multiple parties
- Assistant burden and frustration with complex coordination
- Lost case momentum and client dissatisfaction with delays

---

### Flow 3: Internal + Single-Party 🔄 PHASE 1 EXPANSION

**Use Case**: Partner needs to meet 1:1 with associate to discuss case strategy.

**Initiator**: Can be either user-initiated or 3rd party-initiated
- User-initiated: Partner requests time with associate for guidance
- 3rd party-initiated: Associate requests partner time for case review

**Current Workflow**:
1. One party messages/emails the other requesting meeting
2. Quick calendar check by both parties
3. Time proposed and usually quickly accepted (same organization makes this easier)
4. Calendar invite sent
5. Meeting scheduled

**Current Challenges**:
- Still requires manual coordination despite being internal
- Interruptions to partner/associate flow to negotiate time
- No priority filtering—urgent matters treated same as routine check-ins
- When partner has limited availability, multiple back-and-forth exchanges
- No systematic approach to recurring 1:1s (each scheduled manually)
- Difficulty capturing and maintaining scheduling preferences
- Meeting may not align with optimal times for either party

---

### Flow 4: Internal + Multi-Party 📍 PHASE 2+

**Use Case**: Case team meeting with partner, two associates, paralegal, and legal assistant (5 people) to align on case strategy.

**Initiator**: Can be either user-initiated or 3rd party-initiated
- User-initiated: Partner or team lead schedules team meeting
- 3rd party-initiated: Administrator schedules firm-wide or department meeting

**Current Workflow**:
1. Meeting organizer identifies need for group meeting
2. Assistant checks calendars of all required participants
3. Assistant manually identifies overlapping availability
4. Time slot selected based on availability (often suboptimal for some)
5. Calendar invites sent to all participants
6. Conflicts may emerge, requiring rescheduling

**Current Challenges**:
- 30-60 minutes coordination time per multi-party internal meeting
- Larger groups make finding common time increasingly difficult
- Often results in suboptimal times where some participants have conflicts
- Back-to-back scheduling without buffer time considerations
- No consideration of meeting purpose vs. time of day appropriateness
- Recurring team meetings rescheduled manually each occurrence
- As firm grows, scaling challenge for firm-wide meetings

---

### Flow 5: Ad-Hoc Event Change ⭐ PHASE 1 PRIORITY

**Use Case**: Court date rescheduled from June 15 to July 10, forcing cascade of dependent meetings to move (client prep, witness prep, expert consultations, opposing counsel meetings).

**Initiator**: External event or emergency triggers reactive rescheduling
- Court date changes
- Client cancels with short notice
- Partner illness/emergency
- Expert witness availability changes
- Unexpected conflict emerges

**Current Workflow**:
1. Change event occurs (cancellation, reschedule, emergency)
2. Assistant/partner manually identifies all affected or dependent meetings
3. For each affected meeting, initiate individual rescheduling:
   - Contact all participants
   - Find new mutually available times
   - Send new invites
   - Confirm attendance
4. Process repeated for each meeting in cascade (5-10+ meetings common)
5. Takes 3-6 hours for significant cascades
6. Some meetings may be missed or fall through cracks

**Current Challenges**:
- Massive assistant time burden: 3-5 hours per cascade (Problem #5)
- Manual identification of dependent meetings—some missed
- Coordinating reschedules for 5-10+ meetings simultaneously
- Late cancellations (<24hr) leave billable hour gaps that cannot be recovered (Problem #2)
- Lost billable hours: $500-1000 per unfilled gap
- Partner prep time wasted when client cancels last-minute
- Case timeline delays impact client outcomes and satisfaction
- Emergency situations (partner illness) require rescheduling entire day of meetings (8-12 meetings)
- Client relationship damage from poor coordination experience
- Assistant stress and burnout from crisis coordination
- No systematic way to reallocate freed time to productive use
- Revenue impact from delayed or missed billable opportunitiesפח
