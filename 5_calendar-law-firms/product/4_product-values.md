# Product Values

## Control & Trust

- Predictability is king - users must know what will happen before it happens, no surprises
- Transparency over invisible automation - show your work, make the reasoning visible
- Everything is reversible - no permanent mistakes, trust comes from knowing you can't break things
- Personalization creates trust - the system should feel like it knows you, not treat you generically

## Personalization

- Context, memory, preferences - remember what matters to each person and learn from behavior over time
- Personal & team work rhythm - everyone has their own tempo, teams have collective patterns, honor both
- Differentiate between calendars/context - work time is not personal time, minimize the cost of context switching

# Product Approach

## Play nicely with the ecosystem
- Allow to work side by side with other calendars
- We're not replacing everything, we're making it better
- Integration over isolation

## Moat thinking
- Intent plus context memory over time: personal working style, team rhythms, recurrent cadences
- The longer you use it, the better it gets
- Data and learning create defensibility

## Hook & value should be evident in single player mode on day 1
- No waiting for network effects
- Immediate value, not eventual value
- You should feel it working from the start

## Connectors where it matters
- Email, docs, video, CRM, task systems
- We become the orchestrator, not a dead end
- The calendar is the hub, everything else connects through it

## Meet the user where they are
- The product should be clearly integrated into the user's regular way of doing things
- Don't make them change their behavior
- Fit into their world, don't force them into yours

## Users don't work for the product. The product works for the users
- What we can know without asking, don't ask (allow them to correct us)
