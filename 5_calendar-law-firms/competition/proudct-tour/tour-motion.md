## Onboarding
1. Super intimidating, lots of configuration before seeing any value.

## Main Screen
1. Calendar view.
2. Left pane for further navigation/functionality is prominent

## Product
1. A try to do all in one product - meetings, calendar, projects, tasks, agent. Feels like Clickup in a way.
2. Lots of features, low quality.
3. Seems they're trying to root out google/outlook - their default for tasks is to show them only on Motion and not in Gcal/Outlook cal.
4. Very closed garden feeling - trying to become system of records & convert all use cases rather than playing nicely with the ecosystem/workflows.

## AI
1. Isn't really "felt" in the product. Feels very previous generation.
2. There is some general AI "chat with your motion" work but feels like lipstick on a pig.

## Design
1. Very old school.

## Delight / Fun / Nice touches
1. They add events to the calendar for learning the product. Could be nice, they did bad execution.
2. The AI agenda is a nice idea. Execution is poor because it's constraint to limited data (only exists in motion + no prefernces)
