# Motion Product Tour - Raw Thoughts

## Onboarding

1. Super intimidating, lots of configuration before seeing any value.

## Product

1. A try to do all in one product - meetings, calendar, projects, tasks, agent. Feels like Clickup in a way.

2. Lots of features, low quality.

3. Seems they're trying to root out google/outlook - their default for tasks is to show them only on Motion and not in Gcal/Outlook cal.

4. Very closed garden feeling - trying to become system of records & convert all use cases rather than playing nicely with the ecosystem/workflows.

## AI

1. Isn't really "felt" in the product. Feels very previous generation.

2. There is some general AI "chat with your motion" work but feels like lipstick on a pig.

## Design

1. Very old school.
