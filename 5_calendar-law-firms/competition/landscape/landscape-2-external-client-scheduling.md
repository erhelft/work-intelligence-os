## Key Takeaways

**Vertical-specific solutions dominate the legal sector** with six dedicated platforms (Lawmatics, Clio, MyCase, PracticePanther, RunSensible, SimplyBook.me), each positioning around specific practice areas or firm sizes. These integrate deeply with legal workflows like rules-based docketing and document automation.

**Accounting has minimal dedicated scheduling solutions**, with broader PSA platforms or general scheduling tools adapted for tax season (Uku being the exception with accounting-specific practice management).

**Horizontal tools** like Calendly and Trafft serve all professional services vertically but lack legal/accounting-specific compliance features or workflow integration.

**PSA platforms** (Productive, Birdview, Teamwork) target multi-project management environments (agencies, consulting firms) rather than individual client scheduling, with emphasis on resource allocation and capacity planning.

**Price range**: Free tier options exist (Setmore, Zoho Bookings, Timetics.ai), with paid plans ranging \$6–\$99/month for scheduling tools and \$25+/month for PSA platforms.
