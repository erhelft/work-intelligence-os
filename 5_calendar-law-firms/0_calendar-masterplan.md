# Calendar for Law Firms: Execution Plan

## Purpose
Execution tracker for Calendar Intelligence product: what we've done, what comes next, and current status.

---

## Context: Intelligence OS Strategy

This execution plan builds on the completed Intelligence OS strategic foundation (see: `../4_work-intelligence-os/0_intelligence-masterplan.md`).

**Strategic Decision**: Calendar Management × Professional Services (Law Firms) selected as optimal first product and vertical combination (63/70 score across all evaluation criteria).

**Why This Combination**: Billable hour attribution, high meeting volume (25-30+ meetings/week), premium pricing viability ($75-150/user), clear manual workflow to learn from, natural progression to Products 2-3.

---

## Current Status: November 2025

**Where we are**: Strategic foundation complete. Ready to begin competitive analysis and customer discovery.

**Strategic Decision Made**: Calendar Management for Professional Services (Law Firms, 20-200 person firms)

**Architectural Foundation Required from Day One**:
- Integration Layer: Observed data capture (generic across products)
- Learning Mechanism: Extract strategic intent from operational behavior
- Synthesis Engine: Cross-product intelligence that scales in complexity
- Product Features: UI layer on shared intelligence core

## Discovery & Product Definition

### PHASE 5: Calendar Competitive Landscape
**Status**: 🔜 Not Started
**Duration**: 2-3 weeks

**Goal**: Map existing calendar solutions to identify white space where horizontal tools fail professional services needs

**Method**: Competitor research and market gap analysis

**Target**: 20+ competitors across traditional calendars, startups, practice management systems, and adjacent tools

**Main Points**:
- Traditional calendars: Google Calendar, Outlook, Apple Calendar (feature sets, law firm usage, innovation velocity)
- Calendar startups: Reclaim.ai, Motion, Clockwise, Vimcal, Cron (positioning, features, pricing, vertical focus)
- Practice management systems: Clio, MyCase, Smokeball (calendar features, why they haven't built intelligence)
- Adjacent tools: Calendly, Cal.com, x.ai (why they stayed in their lane)
- Gap analysis: Map competitors against 4 core problems, identify white space for law firm wedge

---

### PHASE 6: Law Firm Discovery & Validation
**Status**: 🔜 Not Started
**Duration**: 4-6 weeks

**Goal**: Validate core assumptions about law firm calendar pain and willingness to pay

**Method**: Customer interviews within our ICP (law firms, 20-200 people)

**Target**: 20-30 interviews across partners, practice managers, associates, legal assistants

**Main Points**:
- Meeting volume validation: Do partners really manage 25-30+ meetings/week?
- Pain intensity: How severe is calendar coordination pain?
- Current workflow: How do they manage calendars today? What tools? Who does scheduling?
- Billable hour attribution: How tight is time tracking? Is ROI calculation clear?
- Willingness to pay: Will firms pay $75-150/user for calendar intelligence?
- Feature priorities: Coordination? Context? Capacity planning? Organizational visibility?
- Buyer persona: Who champions this purchase? (practice manager vs overwhelmed partner)
- Practice management integration research (Clio, MyCase APIs and partnership potential)
- Technical feasibility spike (prototype core calendar intelligence for law firm use case)

### PHASE 7: Product Definition
**Status**: 🔜 Not Started
**Duration**: 3-4 weeks

**Goal**: Define exactly what we're building for MVP (Calendar for Law Firms)

**Method**: MVP scoping, GTM planning, design partner recruitment, architecture design

**Target**: Complete product definition with 3-5 committed design partners

**Main Points**:
- MVP scope: Which of 4 core problems to solve first? Law firm-specific features? Integration requirements?
- Go-to-market: Positioning, pricing hypothesis, ICP refinement, distribution strategy
- Design partners: Recruit 3-5 law firms for pilot (free trial, white-glove support, weekly feedback, testimonials)
- Architecture foundation: Learning mechanism design, synthesis engine for multi-product future, Phase 3 data capture requirements

---

### PHASE 8: MVP Build & Design Partner Deployment
**Status**: 🔜 Not Started
**Duration**: 8-12 weeks

**Goal**: Build MVP and deploy to 3-5 law firms showing measurable results

**Method**: Product development and design partner pilot

**Target**: 3-5 law firms using product weekly with measurable time/money savings

**Main Points**:
- Core product: Calendar intelligence features (optimization, scheduling assistance, time blocking)
- Law firm features: Billable hour integration, case associations, partner preferences
- Integrations: Google Calendar, Outlook, practice management systems (start with Clio)
- Learning mechanism: Preference learning, priority inference, constraint discovery
- Design partner deployment: Weekly check-ins, rapid iteration, measure time saved and billable hours recovered

---

### PHASE 9: Market Validation
**Status**: 🔜 Not Started
**Duration**: 12-16 weeks

**Goal**: Prove repeatable sales motion with 10-20 paying law firms

**Method**: Sales execution and product iteration

**Target**: 10-20 paying customers with clear product-market fit signals

**Main Points**:
- Sales validation: Close 10-20 firms at $75-150/user, validate sales cycle <60-90 days
- Product iteration: Build v2 features based on customer feedback, expand from coordination wedge
- PMF signals: Measure retention (target 90%+), expansion, NPS (target 50+), organic referrals
- Multi-product prep: Validate calendar data reveals firm priorities (test Phase 3 hypothesis), plan Product 2 (case management)

---

### PHASE 10: Scale & Multi-Product Expansion
**Status**: 🔜 Not Started
**Duration**: 6-12 months

**Goal**: Scale to 50-100 law firms while launching Product 2 to deepen learning

**Method**: Sales scaling and product expansion

**Target**: 50-100 firms using Calendar, Product 2 launched to existing customers

**Main Points**:
- Scale calendar business: Grow to 50-100 paying firms, optimize sales/onboarding/support
- Launch Product 2: Case management intelligence, integrate with practice management systems
- Synthesis engine: Build cross-product intelligence (Calendar + Projects → reveal firm priorities)
- Trust transfer validation: Does Product 1 success increase Product 2 adoption?
- Optional: Test Calendar × Tech/SaaS as second vertical validation
