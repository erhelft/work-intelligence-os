# Calendar for Law Firms: Execution Plan

## Purpose
Execution tracker for Calendar Intelligence product: what we've done, what comes next, and current status.

---

## Context: Intelligence OS Strategy

This execution plan builds on the completed Intelligence OS strategic foundation (see: `../4_work-intelligence-os/0_intelligence-masterplan.md`).

**Strategic Decision**: Calendar Management × Professional Services (Law Firms) selected as optimal first product and vertical combination (63/70 score across all evaluation criteria).

**Why This Combination**: 
- **Penetration feasibility**: Clear manual infrastructure (EAs managing calendars) provides operational wedge
- **High meeting volume**: 25-30+ meetings/week per partner generates massive learning data
- **Path to premium pricing**: EA productivity entry ($3-5K/month) → billable hour optimization expansion ($75-150/user)
- **Natural progression**: Operational trust → strategic value → Products 2-3

**GTM Approach (Trojan Horse Strategy)**:
- **Phase 1 Entry**: Sell EA productivity to Head of Operations (operational buyer)
- **Phase 1 Expansion**: Partners without EAs adopt for self-scheduling (user base growth)
- **Phase 2 Expansion**: Introduce billable hour optimization to Practice Manager (strategic buyer)

We enter humble (operational efficiency), expand bold (revenue optimization). Law firms are hard to penetrate—proving tactical value before claiming strategic value.

## Current Status: November 2025

**Where we are**: Strategic foundation complete. Ready to begin competitive analysis and customer discovery.

**Strategic Decision Made**: Calendar Management for Professional Services (Law Firms, 20-200 person firms)

**Architectural Foundation Required from Day One**:
- Integration Layer: Observed data capture (generic across products)
- Learning Mechanism: Extract strategic intent from operational behavior
- Synthesis Engine: Cross-product intelligence that scales in complexity
- Product Features: UI layer on shared intelligence core

## Discovery & Product Definition

### PHASE 5: Calendar Competitive Landscape
**Status**: 🔜 Not Started
**Duration**: 2-3 weeks

**Goal**: Map existing calendar solutions to identify white space where horizontal tools fail professional services needs

**Method**: Competitor research and market gap analysis

**Target**: 20+ competitors across traditional calendars, startups, practice management systems, and adjacent tools

**Main Points**:
- Traditional calendars: Google Calendar, Outlook, Apple Calendar (feature sets, law firm usage, innovation velocity)
- Calendar startups: Reclaim.ai, Motion, Clockwise, Vimcal, Cron (positioning, features, pricing, vertical focus)
- Practice management systems: Clio, MyCase, Smokeball (calendar features, why they haven't built intelligence)
- Adjacent tools: Calendly, Cal.com, x.ai (why they stayed in their lane)
- Gap analysis: Map competitors against 4 core problems, identify white space for law firm wedge

---

### PHASE 6: Law Firm Discovery & Validation
**Status**: 🔜 Not Started
**Duration**: 4-6 weeks

**Goal**: Validate Phase 1 entry assumptions (EA productivity) and Phase 2 expansion potential (billable hour optimization)

**Method**: Customer interviews within our ICP (law firms, 20-200 people)

**Target**: 20-30 interviews across EAs/secretaries, Heads of Operations, partners, practice managers

**Phase 1 Entry Validation (Priority)**:
- EA pain intensity: How much time do EAs spend on scheduling coordination? (target: 15-25 hrs/week across firm)
- Current workflow: Who does scheduling? What tools? What's the EA-to-partner ratio?
- Head of Operations pain: Does this role exist? What's their budget authority? What tools do they buy?
- Willingness to pay: Will firms pay $3K-5K/month for EA productivity improvement?
- Adoption blockers: What would prevent EAs from using a new tool?

**Phase 2 Expansion Validation (Secondary)**:
- Partner self-scheduling demand: Do partners without EAs want self-service scheduling?
- Billable hour attribution: How tight is time tracking? Is ROI calculation clear?
- Premium pricing tolerance: Will Practice Managers pay $75-150/user for billable hour optimization?
- Practice management integration: Clio, MyCase APIs and partnership potential

**Buyer persona validation**:
- Phase 1 buyer: Head of Operations / EA Manager / Office Administrator (confirm this role and budget)
- Phase 2 buyer: Practice Manager / Firm Administrator (confirm strategic budget authority)

**Technical feasibility spike**: Prototype core calendar intelligence for EA workflow (not partner-facing initially)

### PHASE 7: Product Definition
**Status**: 🔜 Not Started
**Duration**: 3-4 weeks

**Goal**: Define exactly what we're building for MVP (Calendar for Law Firms) with Phase 1 entry focus

**Method**: MVP scoping, GTM planning, design partner recruitment, architecture design

**Target**: Complete product definition with 3-5 committed design partners (Head of Operations as buyer, EAs as users)

**Main Points**:
- **MVP scope (Phase 1 Entry)**: EA productivity features first—smart availability analysis, conflict detection, cascade rescheduling, coordination automation. Partner self-scheduling as secondary flow.
- **Go-to-market (Staged)**: 
  - Phase 1 positioning: "Smart Scheduling for Law Firms" (EA productivity)
  - Phase 1 pricing: $3K-5K/month operational efficiency pricing
  - Phase 2 positioning: "Calendar Intelligence" (billable hour optimization)
  - Phase 2 pricing: $75-150/user premium pricing
- **Design partners**: Recruit 3-5 law firms via Head of Operations. EAs must be primary users in pilot. Partners without EAs as secondary user group.
- **Architecture foundation**: Learning mechanism design, data capture for Phase 2 billable hour intelligence, synthesis engine for multi-product future

---

### PHASE 8: MVP Build & Design Partner Deployment
**Status**: 🔜 Not Started
**Duration**: 8-12 weeks

**Goal**: Build MVP and deploy to 3-5 law firms showing measurable EA productivity improvement

**Method**: Product development and design partner pilot (EAs as primary users)

**Target**: 3-5 law firms with EAs using product for 60%+ of coordination tasks within 30 days

**Main Points**:
- **Core product (Phase 1 Entry)**: Smart availability analysis, conflict detection/resolution, cascade rescheduling automation, coordination workflow management
- **Secondary flows**: Partner self-scheduling for those without dedicated EA support
- **Integrations**: Microsoft Outlook (primary), Google Calendar (secondary). Practice management (Clio) deferred to Phase 2.
- **Learning mechanism**: EA workflow patterns, partner preferences, client scheduling patterns—data foundation for Phase 2 billable hour intelligence
- **Design partner deployment**: Weekly check-ins with EAs AND Head of Operations. Primary metric: EA time savings. Secondary: partner adoption, error elimination.
- **Phase 2 prep**: Capture all data needed for billable hour optimization even if not surfacing those features yet

### PHASE 9: Market Validation
**Status**: 🔜 Not Started
**Duration**: 12-16 weeks

**Goal**: Prove repeatable Phase 1 sales motion with 10-20 paying law firms, begin Phase 2 expansion testing

**Method**: Sales execution, product iteration, and expansion validation

**Target**: 10-20 paying customers on Phase 1 pricing, 3-5 firms piloting Phase 2 expansion

**Main Points**:
- **Phase 1 sales validation**: Close 10-20 firms at $3K-5K/month via Head of Operations, validate sales cycle <60 days
- **Phase 1 PMF signals**: 80%+ EA retention, 60%+ time savings, 90%+ firm retention, organic referrals
- **Product iteration**: Build based on EA feedback, add partner self-scheduling polish, prepare Phase 2 features
- **Phase 2 expansion testing**: 
  - With 3-5 design partners who have 6+ months data, pilot billable hour optimization features
  - Test upsell to Practice Manager on revenue ROI positioning
  - Validate $75-150/user premium pricing acceptance
- **Multi-product prep**: Validate calendar data reveals firm priorities (test Phase 3 hypothesis), plan Product 2

- Launch Product 2: Case management intelligence, integrate with practice management systems
- Synthesis engine: Build cross-product intelligence (Calendar + Projects → reveal firm priorities)
- Trust transfer validation: Does Product 1 success increase Product 2 adoption?
- Optional: Test Calendar × Tech/SaaS as second vertical validation
