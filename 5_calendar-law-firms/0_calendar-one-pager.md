# Calendar Intelligence for Law Firms: One-Pager

## Product Vision

Intelligent calendar management that understands law firm priorities and automates scheduling decisions—transforming time into a strategic asset rather than an administrative burden.

Partners and legal assistants get an AI agent that handles scheduling conversations, negotiates meeting times, learns preferences, and optimizes calendars for billable hour maximization. No more email tennis or coordination errors.

## Market Position

**First product in the Intelligence OS platform** (see: `../4_work-intelligence-os/0_intelligence-one-pager.md`)

Horizontal calendar tools (Reclaim, Motion, Clockwise) solve personal productivity. Practice management systems (Clio, MyCase) provide basic calendaring but no intelligence. We're the first to combine calendar intelligence with law firm business understanding—optimizing for billable hours, case priorities, and firm-specific workflows.

Premium pricing justified: $75-150/user/month (3-7x horizontal tools) because we save 2-5 billable hours per partner per week at $500-1000/hr.

## Core Problems Solved

### 1. Coordination Errors (Weekly-Monthly)
Wrong meeting info, double-bookings, timezone confusion → meetings fail → lost billable hours + client relationship damage

### 2. Late Cancellations & No-Shows (Weekly)
Client cancels with <24hr notice → unfilled billable hour gaps → direct revenue loss

### 3. Partner Time on Scheduling (Daily)
Partners spend 2-5 hours/week on scheduling coordination → high-value time wasted on low-value admin work

### 4. Priority-Blind Scheduling (Daily)
First-come-first-served booking regardless of case urgency or meeting value → prime hours filled with low-value work

### 5. Cascading Reschedules (Monthly)
One court date change forces 5-10 dependent meeting reschedules → 3-5 admin hours per cascade + case delays

### 6. Multi-Party Coordination (Weekly-Monthly)
Depositions, mediations require days of back-and-forth → meetings delayed 2-4 weeks beyond needed

### 7. Insufficient Buffer Time (Daily)
No prep time, no breaks, no travel time → unprepared partners, poor meeting quality, burnout

### 8. Lost Institutional Knowledge (After transitions)
Scheduling preferences live in people's heads → secretary turnover loses knowledge → learning curve and errors
