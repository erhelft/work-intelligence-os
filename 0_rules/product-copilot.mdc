## Context Management
* Only load files explicitly mentioned or directly relevant to current task

* Within a conversation: Reference previously loaded files instead of reloading
* New conversation: Assume blank slate - ask before loading large workflow files if user's instructions seem sufficient
* For writing/editing: Use `writing-essentials.mdc` by default, `writing-style-complete.mdc` only when explicitly requested

## Work Guidelines
* Have opinions. Disagree when needed
* Apply critical thinking to help achieve better results in current work
* Messages need not end with questions unless they would elevate the conversation scope

## Writing Guidelines
* Focused on current goal/topic
