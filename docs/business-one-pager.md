# One-Pager Template

## Purpose
Quick context for any initiative: what you're building, why it matters, how to validate it, and decision criteria.

---

## Executive Summary

[2-3 paragraph overview answering: What's broken? What are you building? Why now?]

**The Problem**: [State current failure state in business terms - what's broken and what it's costing]

**The Opportunity**: [What you're building and the value it creates - be specific about the transformation]

**Why This Works**: [Market size, timing, strategic positioning - why this is the right entry point]

**Strategic Positioning**: [Are you creating new category or competing on features? Position yourself clearly]

---

## The Opportunity

### Market Size
- **Breadth**: [How many potential customers - be specific with numbers]
- **Depth**: [Volume/frequency at individual customers - prove it's not one-time]
- **Pain intensity**: [How bad does it hurt - can they quantify losses?]
- **Budget availability**: [Why budget exists - P&L impact, strategic priority, etc.]

### Strategic Positioning
**Category**: [What category are you in/creating? How do you describe it in one sentence?]

**The status quo you're replacing**:
- [What exists today - list concrete alternatives/workarounds]
- [What's broken about current state - business outcomes, not features]
- [What trade-offs people make today - this reveals the gap]

**Your new approach**:
- [How you're different - not "better", but fundamentally different]
- [Why it's defensible - what makes this not easily copied]

### Why Now?
1. [Technology unlock - what's newly possible]
2. [Market timing - why customers care now]
3. [Competitive gap - why no one else has done this]

---

## The Problem & Hypothesis

### Primary Problem
**[State the core business failure in one sentence - quantifiable, outcome-focused]**

**Current state creates multiple business failures**:
- **[Failure 1]**: [Specific business impact with estimated costs - "losing $X because..."]
- **[Failure 2]**: [Another concrete failure - customer churn, blind decisions, wasted spend]
- **[Failure 3]**: [Third dimension of pain - prove it's multi-dimensional]

### Value Streams (Priority Order)

#### 1. [Primary Value - Business Outcome Focus]
**Current state - Business impact**: [What's the $ cost of this problem today?]
- [Specific example of failure with numbers]
- [Why can't they fix it with current tools]
- [Multiply by scale to show total cost]

**Our hypothesis**: [What you believe will work - as hypothesis, not claim]
- [Specific mechanism 1]
- [Specific mechanism 2]
- [How it compounds or improves over time]

**Business outcome**: [What specific measurable improvement]

**Proof point**: [How you'll measure success in 2-4 weeks]

#### 2. [Secondary Value - Different Stakeholder]
[Repeat structure: Current state → Hypothesis → Outcome → Proof point]

#### 3. [Tertiary Value - Third Dimension]
[Repeat structure: Current state → Hypothesis → Outcome → Proof point]

_Note: 2-4 value streams. Each should target different stakeholder or business metric._

## Target Audience

### Primary ICP - TO BE VALIDATED
**[High-level description with key characteristics]**

**Core characteristics**:
- **[Attribute 1]**: [Specific range or criteria]
- **[Attribute 2]**: [Why this matters]
- **[Attribute 3]**: [Pain profile]

**Discovery questions** (not assumptions):
- [Segment A - hypothesis about pain/fit]
- [Segment B - alternative hypothesis]
- [Segment C - edge case to test]

**Discovery priority**: [Approach to finding best entry - validate pain first, then optimize]

**Buyer persona** (Primary):
- **Title**: [Role]
- **Pain**: [What keeps them up - in their words, quantified]
- **Budget**: [Why budget exists - tie to P&L]
- **Decision criteria**: [What they need to see to buy]

**Economic buyers** (Influencers with budget):
- **[Role 1]**: [Their specific pain/metric they care about]
- **[Role 2]**: [Different pain/metric]
- **[Role 3]**: [Third dimension of interest]

**Why multi-stakeholder is strength**: [Explain why multiple buyers help vs. hurt]

---

## Current State & Competitive Gaps

### What Exists Today

**[Competitor Category 1]** (Examples)
- **Focus**: [What they optimize for]
- **Gap**: [What they don't do that you do]
- **Positioning**: [How they position themselves]

**[Competitor Category 2]** (Examples)
- **Focus**: [Different optimization]
- **Gap**: [Different gap]
- **Positioning**: [Their framing]

### The White Space
**No one explicitly solves**: [Your unique framing in one sentence]

**The category doesn't exist**:
- **Not "[X]"** (would compete on single metric)
- **Not "[Y]"** (would compete on workflow)
- **But "[Z]"** - [Your new category definition]

**This is white space because**:
1. [Reason 1 - structural market gap]
2. [Reason 2 - technology unlock]
3. [Reason 3 - category creation requires reframing]

---

## Our Approach

### Product Vision (v1)
**[One sentence product description]**

**Core capabilities**:
1. [Capability 1 - user-facing value]
2. [Capability 2 - technical unlock]
3. [Capability 3 - compounding mechanism]
4. [Capability 4 - outcome delivery]
5. [Capability 5 - intelligence/dashboard]

### What Makes This Different

**vs. [Alternative 1]**: [Not X, but Y]
**vs. [Alternative 2]**: [Not better at single thing, but different approach]
**vs. [Alternative 3]**: [Why comparison doesn't apply]

**Key differentiator**: [What compounds over time or creates lock-in]

### Value Propositions (Multi-Stakeholder)

**For [Stakeholder 1]**:
"[Specific outcome they care about - quantified if possible]"

**For [Stakeholder 2]**:
"[Different outcome - different metric]"

**For [Stakeholder 3]**:
"[Third value dimension]"

---

## Success Metrics

### Primary Metrics (Prove in [timeframe])

**1. [Outcome 1]** ([Stakeholder])
- [Specific metric with target]
- [How to measure]
- [Why this proves value]

- [What it validates]

**3. [Outcome 3]** ([Third dimension])
- [Third metric]
- [How to track]
- [Proof point]

_Note: 3-4 primary metrics across different dimensions. Should prove value to multiple stakeholders._

---

## Key Assumptions to Validate

### Problem Validation (Phase 1: Discovery)
**Multi-dimensional pain** (not single pain point):
- [ ] **[Pain dimension 1]**: Do X+ of Y say "[quantifiable problem statement]"?
- [ ] **[Pain dimension 2]**: Do X+ acknowledge "[second dimension]"?
- [ ] **[Pain dimension 3]**: Do X+ believe "[third dimension]"?
- [ ] **Dollar quantification**: Can they estimate losses from each problem?
- [ ] **Multi-stakeholder interest**: Do [Role 1] + [Role 2] + [Role 3] ALL quantify pain?
- [ ] **Willingness to buy new category**: Will they buy "[your framing]" vs. comparing to [commodity]?
- [ ] **[Segment/platform mapping]**: Which [segment/platform] has most acute pain?

### Solution Validation (Phase 1: Technical Spike)
**[Core capability claim]** (not just [feature]):
- [ ] **[Capability 1]**: Can we deliver [specific measurable outcome]?
- [ ] **[Capability 2]**: Does [experience claim] actually work?
- [ ] **[Capability 3]**: Can system [learning/compound claim]?
- [ ] **[Capability 4]**: Can we [specific technical unlock]?

### Category Validation (Phase 1: Competitive Audit)
**New category, not feature competition**:
- [ ] **White space confirmed**: No one positions as "[your category definition]"
- [ ] **Category gap**: Existing tools are [X] OR [Y], not [your approach]
- [ ] **Newly possible**: Is [technology unlock] truly the enabler?
- [ ] **Framing acceptance**: Do customers buy "[your framing]" vs. "[commodity comparison]"?
- [ ] **Defensibility**: Clear moat through [mechanism]?

### Market Validation (Phase 4)
**[Business model type]**:
- [ ] **TAM sufficiency**: Can we reach $[X]M+ ARR in chosen [segment/platform]?
- [ ] **[Segment] validated**: Did we pick right entry point? (highest pain + feasible + weak competition)
- [ ] **Multi-buyer sales**: Do we win with [Stakeholder 1] + [2] + [3] champions?
- [ ] **Category pricing power**: Can we charge premium because we're not comparable?
- [ ] **Retention mechanism**: Do customers stay because [switching cost/compounding value]?
- [ ] **Expansion viability**: Does [entry] unlock [expansion] with same pattern?

## Go/No-Go Decision Criteria

### Proceed to Build IF:
✅ **Multi-dimensional pain validated**: X+ can quantify losses from [dimension 1], [2], [3]  
✅ **Multi-stakeholder interest**: [Stakeholder 1] + [2] + [3] each quantify their own $X pain  
✅ **Category acceptance**: Customers buy "[your framing]" (not comparing to [commodity])  
✅ **White space confirmed**: No one positions as "[your category]"  
✅ **Technical proof**: [Core capability] works ([specific measurable result])  
✅ **TAM sufficient**: $[X]M+ ARR potential in chosen [segment/platform]  
✅ **[Segment] identified**: Clear winner on pain × feasibility × competition  

### Pivot to [Alternative Segment] IF:
- **Pain validated** BUT wrong [segment/platform] choice
- Example: [What you'd learn that would trigger this]
- Keep same positioning, optimize entry point

### Pivot to [Alternative Use Case] IF:
- **[Core value] validated** BUT [entry point] too crowded/competitive
- **Same pattern**: [Similar stakeholders/pain structure]
- **Same category positioning**: "[Framing]" (not "[commodity comparison]")

### Abort or Rethink IF:
- **Can't quantify pain**: Customers say "yeah it's a problem" but can't estimate $X losses
- **Single-metric trap**: Customers only care about [one dimension] (commoditizes you)
- **No multi-stakeholder interest**: Only [one role] cares, not [others] (weak positioning)
- **Category rejection**: Customers compare you to [existing category] on single metric
- **Competition exists**: You missed major "[your category]" player
- **Technical insufficient**: Can't deliver [core capability] ([specific failure])
- **TAM too small**: <$[X]M ARR potential even with optimistic assumptions

## Strategic Context

**Where this fits in overall vision**:
- **Entry wedge**: [This initiative] ([why this first])
- **Year 2 expansion**: [Natural next step] ([same pattern/buyer])
- **Year 3 expansion**: [Broader category] ([platform play])
- **Long-term vision**: [Transformative end state]

**Why start here**:
- [Reason 1 - structural advantage]
- [Reason 2 - market timing]
- [Reason 3 - strategic positioning]
- [Reason 4 - natural expansion path]

**Why [category creation / your approach] matters**:
- [Why not competing on features]
- [What you control as category leader]
- [How this compounds or creates moat]
- [Why expansion works with same pattern]

**Decision philosophy**:
[Your approach to validation - lean, evidence-based, pivot vs. persist criteria]

**Critical validation questions**: 
1. **[Question 1]**: [What you need to know to proceed]
2. **[Question 2]**: [Key risk to validate]
3. **[Question 3]**: [Make-or-break assumption]

## Guidelines for Filling This Template

### 1. Frame Problems as Business Outcomes (NOT Feature Gaps)
**❌ Bad**: "The system doesn't learn" / "Forms are static" / "No AI capability"
**✅ Good**: "Product teams waste $50K shipping wrong fixes because they're blind to root causes"

**Rule**: If you can't quantify the business impact, it's not a problem worth solving.

### 2. Multi-Dimensional Value (NOT Single Metric Competition)
**❌ Bad**: "We reduce fraud by 30%" (single metric invites commodity comparison)
**✅ Good**: "We deliver insights for Product + satisfaction for CX + fraud protection for Finance"

**Rule**: Need 3+ value dimensions targeting different stakeholders. Single metric = race to bottom.

### 3. Category Creation Over Feature Competition
**❌ Bad**: "Better fraud detection than X" (you're now competing on their terms)
**✅ Good**: "Intelligent returns that learn" (you define the evaluation criteria)

**Rule**: If customers can directly compare you to existing solutions on single metric, you're in commodity trap.

### 4. Discovery-Driven Assumptions (NOT Premature Optimization)
**❌ Bad**: "Primary ICP: Shopify stores $5M-50M GMV" (optimizing for ease before validating pain)
**✅ Good**: "Discovery question: Which platform has most acute pain?" (find pain first)

**Rule**: Mark segments/platforms as "TO BE VALIDATED" until you have evidence. Optimize after validation, not before.

### 5. Hypothesis Format for Solutions (NOT Claims)
**❌ Bad**: "Our AI will reduce fraud by 30%"
**✅ Good**: "Our hypothesis: System can learn patterns from outcomes to adapt faster than fraudsters"

**Rule**: You don't know if it works yet. State as hypothesis with specific mechanism to test.

### 6. Quantifiable Proof Points (NOT Vague Goals)
**❌ Bad**: "Improve customer experience" / "Better insights"
**✅ Good**: "20+ point CSAT improvement" / "3-5x more actionable context per interaction"

**Rule**: Every proof point needs a number and timeframe. "Better" is not measurable.

### 7. Stakeholder Pain in Their Words (NOT Your Solution Language)
**❌ Bad**: "Need conversational AI forms"
**✅ Good**: "We're bleeding $X on returns—can't reduce rates, can't stop fraud, losing customers"

**Rule**: Buyers don't care about your technology. They care about their P&L. Speak their pain language.

### 8. Abort Criteria as Important as Proceed Criteria
**❌ Bad**: Only define success cases
**✅ Good**: Clear triggers for pivot or abort (can't quantify pain = abort)

**Rule**: Knowing when to stop is as valuable as knowing when to go. Define both clearly.

### 9. Strategic Context Explains "Why This, Why Now"
**❌ Bad**: Jump straight to product specs
**✅ Good**: "This is entry wedge → expands to Y → ultimately becomes Z"

**Rule**: Investors/stakeholders need to see the long game. One-pager should show 3-year trajectory.

### 10. Concrete Examples Over Abstract Concepts
**❌ Bad**: "Improve efficiency" / "Better data quality"
**✅ Good**: "Reduce manual review time 60% = save $50K/year in ops costs"

**Rule**: Every abstract benefit should have concrete example with numbers. Force specificity.
